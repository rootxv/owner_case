# owner_case
by Xavi (Sandor) Villalta

This is the dbt project I was tasked with creating for the Owner case study.
Here is the link to some of the data exploration I utilized along with some notes:

The two biggest opportunities that I saw were:
1) Scale the Outbound Sales team
The ROI on predicted sales for successful Outbound Sales opportunities was 50% higher than that of the Inbound Sales (300% vs 200% on a monthly basis).
If we needed somewhere to scale budget, it might be prudent to increase the amount of outbound calling. Outbound seems to have a better CAC:LTV ratio.

2) Train/add staff to close opportunities on time
The two of the top 3 reasons why an opportunity failed to close successfully were 'No Demo Held' and 'Lack of Urgency'.
With this data it is hard to tell whether or not 'No Demo Held' was due to the fault of support staff, but it definitely warrants looking into.
If we were to improve/expedite this process, we could see a higher conversion rate from both the Inbound and Outbound funnels and therefore improve overall CAC:LTV.


There were a few aspects of the data sets that I wish were different or thought might be improved. I included my suggestions in the models and notes on the google sheet.
It seems like I am unable to upload the dbt project I created directly from Snowflake, so I will just copy the models folder and a couple project files to show the important bits.
Feel free to check out the project itself on Snowflake (if that's possible, not sure since I'm unfamiliar with this specific tech stack).
